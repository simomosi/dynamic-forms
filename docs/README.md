## What is it and what can I do with it
DynamicForms is a client library to automate progressive filtering and initialisation of dynamic fields in an easy and fast way.

It supports the developer in managing and centralizing all forms interactions.

It's written in *typescript* and built with *Vite*

Here's some examples.

### Progressive filtering

![Dynamic Select example gif](./imgs/dynamic-select.gif){ loading=lazy }

### Automatic fields initialisation with dynamic content

![Dynamic Form initialisation gif](./imgs/initialisation.gif){ loading=lazy }

The progressive filtering status is restored: all the available options are automatically fetched.

### Visibility changes depending on fields' state

![Dynamic Checkbox example gif](./imgs/dynamic-checkbox.gif){ loading=lazy }

### Updating rules

![Dynamic Radio example gif](./imgs/dynamic-radio.gif){ loading=lazy }

### Much much more

## Main features
- [x] **Easy to use**: DynamicForms works in a declarative way; no code with the default behavior, just a simple configuration!
- [x] **Modern javascript and backward compatible**: works on all browsers!
- [x] **Lightweight**: having no dependencies, you can integrate it everywhere!
- [x] **Automate repetitive and boring operations**: read values, fetch data making async remote calls, update fields' status, clear other fields, hide/show sections... even listing them is BORING!
- [x] **Highly customizable**: are you using an external library with custom html elements? Don't worry as you can specify your own functions to read/write data
