# Installation
## Using a package manager

=== "npm"
    ```shell
    npm i @simomosi/dynamic-forms
    ```
=== "Yarn"
    ```shell
    yarn add @simomosi/dynamic-forms
    ```

This will put the library under the path `node_modules/@simomosi/dynamic-forms/dist/dynamicforms.min.js`

## Using local files
Download the last release from [GitHub release section](https://github.com/simomosi/dynamic-forms/releases). Extracts files in your assets folder and load them in your project (see section below).

This is not the recommended method because you can't get updates automatically.

If you still want to proceed this way, it is recommended to use the minified file (*dynamicforms.min.js*) for better performance.
