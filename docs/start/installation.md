# Installation
## Using a package manager (recommeded)

=== "npm"
    ```shell
    npm i @simomosi/dynamic-forms
    ```
=== "Yarn"
    ```shell
    yarn add @simomosi/dynamic-forms
    ```

## Using a CDN

```html
<script src='https://unpkg.com/@simomosi/dynamic-forms@latest'></script>
```

You can set the specific version (e.g. `dynamic-forms@2.0.0`), use tags (e.g. `dynamic-forms@latest`) or semver ranges (e.g. `dynamic-forms@^2.0.0`).
See [UNPKG page](https://www.unpkg.com/) for more information.

## Using local files
Download the last release from [GitHub release section](https://github.com/simomosi/dynamic-forms/releases). Extracts files in your assets folder and load them in your project (see next section).

This is not the recommended method because you can't get security updates automatically.

If you still want to proceed this way, it is recommended to use the minified file (`dist/dynamicforms.min.js`) for better performance.
